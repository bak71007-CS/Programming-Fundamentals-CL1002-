A Programming Fundamentals Lab is a hands-on course designed for beginners to learn core programming concepts, usually in C/C++ or a similar language, through practical experimentation. It focuses on writing, compiling, debugging, and testing code, covering topics like data types, control structures (loops, if-else), arrays, pointers, functions, and file handling.
