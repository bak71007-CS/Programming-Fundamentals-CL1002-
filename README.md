# Programming Fundamentals (CL1002)

**Student Name:** Bilal Ahmed Khan


**Roll Number:** 25K-6507


**Section:** BCE-2A

A Programming Fundamentals Lab is a hands-on course designed for beginners to learn core programming concepts, usually in C++ or a similar language, through practical experimentation. It focuses on writing, compiling, debugging, and testing code, covering topics like data types, control structures (loops, if-else), arrays, pointers, functions, and file handling. 

## Objective

The objective of the Programming Fundamentals (PF) Lab is to develop a strong foundation in programming concepts and problem-solving skills. 

This lab consist concept of:

- Basic syntax and structure of the C programming language
- Input and output operations
- Data types and variables
- Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Arrays and basic problem solving techniques

The PF Lab focuses on logical thinking, algorithm development, and writing efficient and structured programs. It helps students understand how to design, implement, and test small-scale programs effectively.
